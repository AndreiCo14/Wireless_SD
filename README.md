# Wireless_SD

A normal micro SD to SD adapter is converted into a wireless Card reader using esp12E with FTP support.
Files can be transferred to SD and also files can be copied from SD to any device where you can run an FTP client.
For this particular project I used the AndFTP client for Android and the same process can be followed in PC by using WinSCP.
